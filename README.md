# My Notes

This is a personal repo where I have written down things that I have find of importance. For me, 
writing something down makes it more permanent, more concrete, more real. So, for me to do that
I have created this, a repository for me to reference concepts about computer science, a git command
that I keep forgetting the true meaning behind, or some things that I just think that are neat.

If you find joy in these, nice! I hope you may find the information inside helpful as well.
