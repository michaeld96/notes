# Git Commands

## Download Updates to your Local Repo
* `git fetch <remote-repo> <branch>` - This is a command that downloads commits, files, and references from a remote 
                repository to your local repository.
  * Example: `git fetch origin main` - This fetches the latest commits, files, and references from the `main` branch of the `origin` remote repository.
